# Quantarksâ„¢ Information Architecture

1. Features available offline:
  - Everything in the [JSON file](https://bit.ly/2JuZx4y) 
2. Features available *only* when online
  - Voice over (a voice that explains the elements in detail)
  
3. Additional questions to consider

    1. How would the app look like when it detects...
        - periodic table?
        - compound? (in the cue card)
        - an individual element (whether from the periodic table, or drawn on paper)?
    2. How does the *About* screen look like?
    3. How does the app look like when nothing is happening? (empty state)
    4. How does it look like when it detects an element or compound but it doesn't have the information about it?
    5. How about the animations and the transitions from screen to screen? How do they look like?
